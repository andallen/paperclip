The blob should start at the top and gradually move downward as each new line appears. If this is working correctly, you'll see the orbiting circles stay positioned just below the last line of visible text throughout the entire animation. This paragraph has been deliberately made very long to ensure we get plenty of line wraps to thoroughly test the behavior. Let's add even more text to make absolutely sure we have enough content to see the effect clearly across many lines of streaming text.",
